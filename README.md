 **:memo:Biography**

I am a scientist and educator, holding a PhD in Biological Sciences from Clemson University in 2018. Using the soil nematode _Caenorhabditis elegans_ as a model organism, I investigated the potential of natural dietary supplements and nutraceuticals to promote healthy aging. Notably, my research unveiled the efficacy of royal jelly supplementation in enhancing _C. elegans_' ability to combat both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, even in old age. Additionally, I demonstrated the immune-boosting properties of royal jelly, linking these effects to Wnt signaling, a canonical developmental pathway. This work shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying innate immunity with age, offering insights into strategies for promoting healthy aging.

I have a solid background in Microbiology through an MSc in Microbiology from the University of Mumbai, and a B.Sc in Microbiology from the same institution. My passion for research has been cultivated since pursuing Honors research in the undergraduate program. I have constantly used this understanding of microbes to further study their impact in various hosts and environments.

I have seamlessly integrated research and teaching throughout his career. From my roles as a Teaching Assistant at Clemson University to my tenure as a Lecturer at S.S.&L.S. Patkar College and an Adjunct faculty member at Bhavans College in Mumbai, I  have consistently demonstrated a passion for sharing knowledge and nurturing future scientists. 


**:microscope:Research Interests**

Microbes are invisible parameters that contribute to all natural phenomena from aging, diseases to climate change. However, other than diseases, their roles are often overlooked. My research centers on using molecular biology and genetic engineering approaches to study roles of microbes in animal development and gut health. Because animal-microbe interactions are ubiquitous in both marine and terrestrial environments, my research has broad applications on the conservation of marine ecosystems and beyond.

I currently use the marine invertebrate model _Ciona robusta_ to understand how bacteriophages, viruses that are integrated in the genome of gut bacteria (lysogens) influence host colonization dynamics. I am also interested in transkingdom interactions across gut bacteria, viruses and fungi on host development and health. I am developing _Caenorhabditis elegans_ as a model to understand host microbe interactions with clinically relevant microbes.
