 **:memo:Biography**

I am a scientist and educator,  interested in understanding the signifiance of micro organisms in our day to day lives. I have a speial curiosity for the imppact of microbes on development, immunity and aging. 
I possess a strong background in microbiology and have conducted extensive research on the impact of microbes in various hosts and environments. I have experience studying molecular 
Currently, I am serving as a Research Associate at the University of South Florida, and I am deeply committed to advancing scientific discovery and mentoring the next generation of researchers.
I have always balanced research and teaching throughout his career. From my roles as a Teaching Assistant at Clemson University to my tenure as a Lecturer at S.S.&L.S. Patkar College and an Adjunct faculty member at Bhavans College in Mumbai, I  have consistently demonstrated a passion for sharing knowledge and nurturing future scientists. 


**:microscope:Research Interests**

Microbes are invisible parameters that contribute to all natural phenomena from aging, diseases to climate change. However, other than diseases, their roles are often overlooked. My research centers on using molecular biology and genetic engineering approaches to study roles of microbes in animal development and gut health. Because animal-microbe interactions are ubiquitous in both marine and terrestrial environments, my research has broad applications on the conservation of marine ecosystems and beyond.

I currently use the marine invertebrate model _Ciona robusta_ to understand how bacteriophages, viruses that are integrated in the genome of gut bacteria (lysogens) influence host colonization dynamics. I am also interested in transkingdom interactions across gut bacteria, viruses and fungi on host development and health. I am developing _Caenorhabditis elegans_ as a model to understand host microbe interactions with clinically relevant microbes.
